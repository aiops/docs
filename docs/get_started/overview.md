## Key Features

You can integrate logsight.ai into your CI/CD pipeline and connect to a variety of log data sources.
Logsight analyses collected logs, calculates deployment risk scores to provide confidence into you next release, and monitors your deployment to raise notifications in case of imminent problems.

+ **[Auto Logging](/logging_code_inspection/overview.md)**. Optimize the logging of your code base. Get hints where log messages are missing in your code. Improve the semantic and syntactic quality of log messages (coming soon).

+ **[Stage Verification](/stage_verification/overview.md)**. Verify different CI/CD pipeline stages of your application. Compare logsight.ai log data analysis results between the previous and the next release to get insight into the deployment risk score. Gain confidence in you next release.

+ **[Incident Detection](/incident_detection/overview.md)**. Monitor log data of applications in your production or pre-production environments. The incident detection of logsight.ai proactively detects problems and allows notification and alerting.


## Workflow

1. `Shipping logs`. You set up a log collector to gather logs across your deployments.
Ship the logs of the baseline version, candidate version, or production logs to our centralized logging platform.
2. `AI-processing`. We search and analyze your logs to identify any deployment and production abnormality using various AI-models.
4. `Customer AI model`. We can also use specialised and customized AI-models to model customers' IT systems. 
5. `Stage Verifier`. Using real-time comparisons and semantic analysis, our AI-models are capable of identifying anomalies and regressions.
6. `Notification`. We send you a notification when we detect problems so you can rapidly roll back failed deployments and quickly fix issues.
