# User info

> [!TIP]
> The user info screen can be found by clicking the `username` in the top right corner of the screen and selecting `Profile` from the menu.

The user info section contains the `Username` (email) and the `User ID` of the user. The `User ID` is important for several operations in logsight (e.g., creating applications, sending logs, etc.). It is used as user identifier inside the platform.
