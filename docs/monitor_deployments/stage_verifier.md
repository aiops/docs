# Stage Verifier

![Stage Verifier](./stage_verifier.png)

`logsight.ai` supports the continuous verification of deployments, comparing tests, detecting test flakiness 
and other log verification tasks.


## Processing Workflow

1. `Shipping logs`. You set up a log collector to gather logs across your deployments.
Ship the logs of the baseline version and candidate version to our centralized logging platform.
2. `AI-processing`. We search and analyze your logs to identify any deployment abnormality using various AI-models.
4. `Customer AI model`. We can also use specialised and customized AI-models to model customers' IT systems. 
5. `Continuous verification`. Using real-time comparisons, our AI-models are capable of identifying anomalies and regressions.
6. `Notification`. We send you a notification when we detect problems so you can rapidly roll back failed deployments.

## Intelligent Verification

### Template mining
Template mining is an intelligent method for transforming unstructured log into structured log records.
A log record usually contains: timestamp, level, thread ID, component ID, text, etc. 
Template mining converts the text field, which describes a state of an IT system, into a feature vector of variables/values. 
Feature vectors are needed since they enable AI-driven processing of logs.

### Semantic analysis
The baseline version and candidate version of an application are compared using semantics.
It compares the logs generated by the old version of the application: the baseline version, with
the logs of the new app version: the candidate version.

Semantic analysis relies on natural language understanding (NLU) to compare logs. 
It uses an AI-model trained to understand the hidden and underlying latent semantics of words in logs messages.
This allows to compare logs and discover differences which are correlated with failures.
