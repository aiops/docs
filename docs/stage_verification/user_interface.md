# User Interface

Stage verification display information using 3 tabs:

+ Overview
+ Insights
+ Analytics


# Overview 

### Create Verification 

To trigger a new verification, add the `Baseline tags` and the `Candidate tags` for the application you want to analyze.
Click on the `Create` button to start the verification. 

![Logs](imgs/create_verification.png ':size=1200')

A verification ID will be created and displayed in the `Overview` table.


### Overview

The overview table shows all the verifications already made. Each row displays:
+ Verification date and ID
+ Baseline and candidate tags
+ Risk and severity 
+ Status

![Logs](imgs/overview.png ':size=1200')

A verification can have the status: `Raised`, `Assigned` or `Resolved`. 
When a verification completes, its status is set to `Raised`. 
If the verification yielded a high risk and severity, it can be set to `Assigned` to indicate that a developer was allocated to investigate the root cause.
When the issue is fixed, the status can be set to `Resolved`.

To obtained more information on a verification, the option `View Insights` redirects you to the insights tab.


# Insights

Verification insights displays information about:

+ Verification ID and tags
+ Deployment failure risk and statistics   
+ State overview
+ State analysis


### Verification ID and tags

The upper part of the insights page shows information about the verification and its tags.  

+ Verification ID and creation date
+ Baseline tags and candidate tags, and the number of log messages and states processed by a verification

![Logs](imgs/verification.png ':size=1200')


### Deployment failure risk and statistics  

The deployment failure risk takes a value from the range [0, 100].

![Logs](imgs/deployment_risk.png ':size=1200')

The next box shows the `Total log messages` which is the sum of the number of log messages of the baseline and candidate. The following two numbers indicate the number of log messages of the baseline and the percentage of change of the candidate with respect to the baseline.  


### State overview

The state overview shows the characteristics of the states generated by the baseline and candidate versions of the application, namely:

+ Number of `Added states`
+ Number of `Deleted states`
+ Number of `Recurring states`
+ `Frequency change` of states

![Logs](imgs/state_overview.png ':size=1200')

Added, deleted, and recurrent states are characterized from a semantic perspective. 
For each characteristic, the percentage of report and fault states involved is shown. 
    


### State analysis
The state analysis table describes each state present in the baseline and candidate versions:

+ Risk score (low, medium, high) 
+ Description (added, deleted or recurrent state)
+ Percentage of this type of state in the baseline and candidate logs
+ State structure generated by `state mining`
+ Number of times the state was seen in the baseline and in the candidate
+ State change (percentage and count) from the baseline to the candidate 
+ Percentage of states of this type in the baseline and candidate
+ State level 
+ State semantics

![Logs](imgs/state_analysis.png ':size=1200')

This table is generally used to identify which new error states were introduced by a new version.

> [!INFO] 
> Upcoming feature: States will be linked to the code that generated them    
 
 
# Analytics

Verification analytics display information about:

+ KPI
+ Risk history
+ Status statistics

### Filter

To display analytics of past verifications made, you use the filter to select which verifications should be part of the analysis. 
This is done by selecting `Baseline tags`.

![Logs](imgs/filter.png ':size=1200')


### KPI

The KPI show 3 metrics that indicate the performance of the software development team: 
+ Verification Frequency. How often verifications are made
+ Lead Time for Changes. Amount of time it takes for a version to be verified
+ Change Failure Ratio. Percentage of verifications causing a failure in pre-production

![Logs](imgs/kpi.png ':size=1200')

More information on these metrics can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance)


### Risk

The risk panel aggregates and shows the deployment risk of verifications over time. 
+ Mean, minimum, maximum deployment risk
+ Chart with risk statistics for each period (e.g., week)

![Logs](imgs/risk.png ':size=1200')


### Issues

Issues shows the number of verifications made, the number of verifications which raised an issue, how many issues were assigned and how many issues were resolved. 

![Logs](imgs/issues.png ':size=1200')
