#### Incident
An unplanned interruption to or quality reduction of an IT service.

**Anomaly.** An anomaly is a point, event, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset's normal behavior.

**Tag.**
Tags make a point as a specific point in Git history.
[Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1. 0.1).
