#### Tag
Tags make a point as a specific point in Git history.
[Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1. 0.1).

#### Log type
A log type (or log template) is a structured description of an unstructured log message. 
It typically includes variables (e.g., IP address, service name) and a textual description.
Groups of log messages are clustered into a log template representing a state of a system.
