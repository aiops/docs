# Logstash

logsight.ai enables integration with Logstash.

## Prerequisites
1. [Install `Logstash`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html)

Depending on your deployment (i.e., web service, demo or on-premise), you need to replace the placeholder ```$URL``` 
with the correct value.

+ web service: ```$URL = https://logsight.ai``` 
+ demo service: ```$URL = https://demo.logsight.ai``` 
+ on-premise service: ```$URL = http://localhost:8080```

## Start sending logs

First we need to use a ruby code segment to share the event structure flowing through the logstash.
If you need to have a “Dynamic” Application and Tag, this is the place to make sure they are set.
In this example we assume the json structure of the message has the application and tag fields. Those fields can be generated by the logstash filters as well.
If you need them to be remain static you may to replace the event.get with a plain string.

### Filter configuration

```
filter {
    # special case if input is http
	if [@metadata][input-http] {
        date {
          match => [ "date", "UNIX" ]
          remove_field => [ "date" ]
        }
        mutate {
          remove_field => ["headers","host"]
        }
    }
   # structuring the output event
   ruby {  
        code => '
                # create an application in logsight http://localhost:4200/pages/profile or via the API and use the ID here
		event.set("applicationId", "c87f6960-69f6-4ecc-888a-7ac58a69fae5")
		# tag can be set dynamically, e.g., container_image_id
		event.set("tag", event.get('tag')) 
                # this needs to contain the message of the log 
		event.set("message", event.get('[log][msg]'))
		' 
        }
   # cleaning the message
   mutate {
        gsub => [
        "message", "\"", "", "message", "[\\?#-+]", ""
   	    ]
        }
}
```

Once the Event is ready we need to configure the output itself to send the logs.

### Output configuration

```
output {
   http {
        url => "$URL/api/v1/logs"
        content_type => "application/json"
        http_method => "post"
        format => message
        message => '{"applicationId":"%{applicationId}", "logs":[{"timestamp":"%{@timestamp}", "message":"%{message}"}], "tag":"%{tag}"}'
        headers => {
            "Authorization" => "Basic c2FzaG9uZWRlbGtvc2tpQGdtYWlsLmNvbTpzYXNobzEyMw=="
                    }
        }
}
```
To generate the Basic authorization header you can use https://www.debugbear.com/basic-auth-header-generator, Postman, or in Linux base systems (`echo -n user:password | base64`) .
